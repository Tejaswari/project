			<p>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccine Tracker: While governments have been found more than willing to relax regulatory provisions to make a coronavirus vaccine available to their public at the earliest, a pushback now seems to be coming from the vaccine developers themselves.

According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, some of the top vaccine developers, including Pfizer, were planning to release a common statement, pledging not to seek regulatory approval for their products till their safety and effectiveness was firmly established. The report said the joint statement, planned to be released early next week, was still being prepared. Apart from Pfizer, US biotech company Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, are also reported to be on board.

The companies were planning to promise to adhering to the highest scientific and ethical standards in developing and releasing their vaccines.</p>
